    * A set of hook functions to customize an experimental run.
    * <p>
    * It is very difficult to identify a set of features that can cover all
    * the possible use cases of multi-robot systems.  Even though some
    * features, such as robot motion, are almost always necessary, many
    * other features depend on the type of experiment considered. For
    * instance, the metrics against which statistics must be calculated
    * depend on the experiment. Also, if the environment presents custom
    * dynamics, such as objects being added or removed as a result of the
    * actions of the robots, these mechanisms need to be implemented in the
    * simulator. The need for specific and often divergent features renders
    * the design of a generic simulator extremely complex. Furthermore, the
    * approach of trying to add a myriad of features in the attempt to cover
    * every possible use case usually renders the learning curve of a tool
    * much steeper, hindering usability and maintainability.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * To cope with these issues, we followed the common approach of
    * providing user-defined function hooks in strategic points of the
    * simulation loop. In ARGoS, these hooks are called <em>loop
    * functions</em>.  The user can customize the initialization and the end of
    * an experiment, and add custom functionality executed before and/or
    * after each simulation step. It is also possible to define custom end
    * conditions for an experiment.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * Loop functions allow one to access and modify the entire
    * simulation. In this way, the user can collect figures and statistics,
    * and store complex data for later analysis. It is also possible to
    * interact with the simulation by moving, adding or removing entities in
    * the environment, or by changing their internal state.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * Finally, loop functions can be used to prototype new features before
    * they are promoted to the core ARGoS code.
    * </p>
