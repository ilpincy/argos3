[CORE]
- The distribute method should honor the random seed, which is not the case now. This prevents repeatability!
- Move to
  - The logic of undoing a move should stay in the CEmbodiedEntity, and in the CPhysicsModel::MoveTo() should just move an object and say whether this create a collision.
  - Call UpdateEntityStatus from CEmbodiedEntity::MoveTo()

[MAC]
- The configuration file is stored in $HOME/Library/Preferences/be.ac.ulb.Iridia.ARGoS3.plist.

[LUA]
- Multifile editing is broken; when an error occurs, the line that is displayed in the editor is correct, but not the file
- When the Lua script has an error, and the editor is not displayed, there's no error displayed
- See test_objectoriented.lua; when you have self-references, the lua state model gets into an infinite recursion and the everything blows up.
